## Report Structure
1. Abstract

The major goal of Adobe's social media site Behance is to promote and help people find creative work. Joining Behance allows creatives from all over the world to participate in a community that was built with their original work and creative process in mind. 

2. Dataset Description

Only a portion of the "appreciate" data, which includes 1 million appreciates from 63,497 people on 178,788 items (i.e. projects on https://www.behance.net/), can be made public due to data sensitivity. From June 9, 2011, to November 14, 2011, these appreciations took place. With Behance, you can give another creative expert sincere praise by sending them appreciations, which are similar to likes. Therefore, in this project we will discuss two research questions.

3. Research question (1): 
    * Is it possible to predict the frequent itemsets in the dataset? Can we predict the future likes 'appreciations' of the users using recommender systems algorithm? 

4. Research question (2):
    * Which recommender systems algorithm provides the best prediction accuracy?

To answer this research question, we will need to use Behance_appreciate_1M.gz dataset that has data in the form of a triplet, where each line is (user id, item id, unix timestamp).

5. Model classes
